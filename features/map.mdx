## Introducing /map (Alpha)

The easiest way to go from a single url to a map of the entire website. This is extremely useful for:
- When you need to prompt the end-user to choose which links to scrape
- Need to quickly know the links on a website
- Need to scrape pages of a website that are related to a specific topic (use the `search` parameter)
- Only need to scrape specific pages of a website

## Alpha Considerations

This endpoint prioritizes speed, so it may not capture all website links. We are working on improvements. Feedback and suggestions are very welcome.


## Mapping

### /map endpoint

<MapResponse />

#### Map with search

Map with `search` param allows you to search for specific urls inside a website.

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/map \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
    -d '{
      "url": "https://firecrawl.dev",
      "search": "docs"
    }'
```

Response will be an ordered list from the most relevant to the least relevant.

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "links": [
    "https://docs.firecrawl.dev",
    "https://docs.firecrawl.dev/sdks/python",
    "https://docs.firecrawl.dev/learn/rag-llama3",
  ]
