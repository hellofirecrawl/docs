Firecrawl thoroughly crawls websites, ensuring comprehensive data extraction while bypassing any web blocker mechanisms. Here's how it works:

1. **URL Analysis:**
   Begins with a specified URL, identifying links by looking at the sitemap and then crawling the website. If no sitemap is found, it will crawl the website following the links.

2. **Recursive Traversal:**
   Recursively follows each link to uncover all subpages.

3. **Content Scraping:**
   Gathers content from every visited page while handling any complexities like JavaScript rendering or rate limits.

4. **Result Compilation:**
   Converts collected data into clean markdown or structured output, perfect for LLM processing or any other task.

This method guarantees an exhaustive crawl and data collection from any starting URL.


## Crawling


### /crawl endpoint

Used to crawl a URL and all accessible subpages. This submits a crawl job and returns a job ID to check the status of the crawl.


<Warning>By default - Crawl will ignore sublinks of a page if they aren't children of the url you provide. So, the website.com/other-parent/blog-1 wouldn't be returned if you crawled website.com/blogs/. If you want website.com/other-parent/blog-1, use the `allowBackwardLinks` parameter</Warning>

### Usage

<CodeGroup>

<CrawlPython />
<CrawlNode />
<CrawlGo />
<CrawlRust />
<CrawlCURL />

</CodeGroup>

### Job ID Response

If you're using cURL or `async crawl` functions on SDKs, this will return an `ID` where you can use to check the status of the crawl.

<AsyncCrawlOutput />

### Check Crawl Job

Used to check the status of a crawl job and get its result.
<CodeGroup>

<CheckCrawlJobPython />
<CheckCrawlJobNode />
<CheckCrawlJobGo />
<CheckCrawlJobRust />
<CheckCrawlJobCURL />

</CodeGroup>

#### Response

The response will be different depending on the status of the crawl.
<CodeGroup>
  <CheckCrawlJobOutputScraping />
  <CheckCrawlJobOutputCompleted />

## Crawl WebSocket

Firecrawl's WebSocket-based method, `Crawl URL and Watch`, enables real-time data extraction and monitoring. Start a crawl with a URL and customize it with options like page limits, allowed domains, and output formats, ideal for immediate data processing needs.

  <CrawlWebSocketNode />
</CodeGroup>

## Crawl Webhook

You can now pass a `webhook` parameter to the `/crawl` endpoint. This will send a POST request to the URL you specify when the crawl is started, updated and completed.

The webhook will now trigger for every page crawled and not just the whole result at the end.

<CrawlWebhookCURL />

### Webhook Events

There are now 4 types of events:

- `crawl.started` - Triggered when the crawl is started.
- `crawl.page` - Triggered for every page crawled.
- `crawl.completed` - Triggered when the crawl is completed to let you know it's done (Beta)**
- `crawl.failed` - Triggered when the crawl fails.

### Webhook Response

- `success` - If the webhook was successful in crawling the page correctly.
- `type` - The type of event that occurred.
- `id` - The ID of the crawl.
- `data` - The data that was scraped (Array). This will only be non empty on `crawl.page` and will contain 1 item if the page was scraped successfully. The response is the same as the `/scrape` endpoint.
- `error` - If the webhook failed, this will contain the error message.

**Beta consideration

- There is a very tiny chance that the `crawl.completed` event may be triggered while the final `crawl.page` events are still being processed. We're working on a fix for this.
