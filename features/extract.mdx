## What is Extract? (Open Beta)

The Extract endpoint lets you pull structured data from websites automatically. Think of it like having an assistant who reads web pages and organizes the information exactly how you want it.

### Quick Example: Company Information

Let's say you want to get information about a company from their website. Here's how simple it is:

<CodeGroup>
<ExtractNoSchemaPython />
<ExtractNoSchemaJS />
<ExtractNoSchemaCURL />
</CodeGroup>

You'll get clean, structured data back:

<ExtractNoSchemaOutput />

## Basic Usage

### 1. Single Page Extraction
Extract data from a single webpage:
```bash
https://firecrawl.dev/about
```

### 2. Multiple Pages
Extract from multiple specific pages:
```bash
["https://firecrawl.dev/about", "https://firecrawl.dev/pricing"]
```

### 3. Full Website Extraction
Extract from an entire website using wildcards:
```bash
"https://firecrawl.dev/*"  # Gets all accessible pages
```

## Getting Started

Let's look at a complete example with both prompt and schema:

<CodeGroup>
<ExtractPython />
<ExtractNode />
<ExtractCURL />
</CodeGroup>

You'll get structured data like this:

<ExtractOutput />

## Two Ways to Extract

### 1. Using Natural Language (Easiest)
Just describe what you want in plain English with a prompt:

<CodeGroup>
<ExtractNoSchemaPython />
<ExtractNoSchemaJS />
<ExtractNoSchemaCURL />
</CodeGroup>

### 2. Using a Schema (More Control)
Define exactly what data you want and how it should be structured:

```json
{
  "schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "company_name": { "type": "string" },
      "employee_count": { "type": "number" },
      "has_free_trial": { "type": "boolean" }
    }
  }
}
```

## Checking Extraction Status

When extracting from large sites, you can check the progress:

<CodeGroup>
<CheckExtractJobPython />
<CheckExtractJobJS />
<CheckExtractJobCURL />
</CodeGroup>

You'll see one of these states:
- **completed** - Extraction is done
- **pending** - Still working
- **failed** - Something went wrong
- **cancelled** - Job was stopped

## Advanced Features

### Web Search Enhancement

Want more complete data? Enable web search to gather information from related pages:

<CodeGroup>
<ExtractWebSearchPython />
<ExtractWebSearchJS />
<ExtractWebSearchCURL />
</CodeGroup>

Example of enriched data:
<ExtractWebSearchOutput />

## Things to Know (Beta Limitations)

1. **Size Limits**
   - ✅ Works great with: Small to medium websites
   - ❌ Not yet ready for: Massive sites (like "all Amazon products")

2. **Complex Queries**
   - ✅ Works great with: "Find current pricing tiers"
   - ❌ Not yet ready for: "Find all posts from 2025"

3. **Data Consistency**
   - Results may vary slightly between runs
   - Core information remains consistent
