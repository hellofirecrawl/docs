## Introducing `/extract` (Open Beta)

The `/extract` endpoint simplifies collecting structured data from any number of URLs or entire domains. Provide a list of URLs, optionally with wildcards (e.g., `example.com/*`), and a prompt or schema describing the information you want. Firecrawl handles the details of crawling, parsing, and collating large or small datasets.

## Using `/extract`

You can extract structured data from one or multiple URLs, including wildcards:

- **Single Page**  
  Example: `https://firecrawl.dev/some-page`
- **Multiple Pages / Full Domain**  
  Example: `https://firecrawl.dev/*`

When you use `/*`, Firecrawl will automatically crawl and parse all URLs it can discover in that domain, then extract the requested data. This feature is experimental; email [help@firecrawl.dev](mailto:help@firecrawl.dev) if you have issues.

### Example Usage

<CodeGroup>

<ExtractPython />
<ExtractNode />
<ExtractCURL />

</CodeGroup>

**Key Parameters:**

- **urls**: An array of one or more URLs. Supports wildcards (`/*`) for broader crawling.
- **prompt** (Optional unless no schema): A natural language prompt describing the data you want or specifying how you want that data structured.
- **schema** (Optional unless no prompt): A more rigid structure if you already know the JSON layout.
- **enableWebSearch** (Optional): When `true`, extraction can follow links outside the specified domain.

See [API Reference](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/api-reference/endpoint/extract) for more details.

### Response (sdks)

<ExtractOutput />

## Asynchronous Extraction & Status Checking

When you submit an extraction job—either directly via the API or through the SDK's asynchronous methods—you'll receive a Job ID. You can use this ID to:

- Check Job Status: Send a request to the /extract/{ID} endpoint to see if the job is still running or has finished.
- Automatically Poll (Default SDK Behavior): If you use the default extract method (Python/Node), the SDK automatically polls this endpoint for you and returns the final results once the job completes.
- Manually Poll (Async SDK Methods): If you use the asynchronous methods—async_extract (Python) or asyncExtract (Node)—the SDK immediately returns a Job ID that you can track. Use get_extract_status (Python) or getExtractStatus (Node) to check the job's progress on your own schedule.

<Note>
  This endpoint only works for jobs in progress or recently completed (within 24
  hours).
</Note>

Below are code examples for checking an extraction job's status using Python, Node.js, and cURL:

<CodeGroup>

<CheckExtractJobPython />
<CheckExtractJobJS />
<CheckExtractJobCURL />

</CodeGroup>

### Possible States

- **completed**: The extraction finished successfully.
- **processing**: Firecrawl is still processing your request.
- **failed**: An error occurred; data was not fully extracted.
- **cancelled**: The job was cancelled by the user.

#### Pending Example

<ExtractStatusPending />

#### Completed Example

<ExtractStatusDone />

## Extracting without a Schema

If you prefer not to define a strict structure, you can simply provide a `prompt`. The underlying model will choose a structure for you, which can be useful for more exploratory or flexible requests.

<CodeGroup>

<ExtractNoSchemaPython />
<ExtractNoSchemaJS />
<ExtractNoSchemaCURL />

</CodeGroup>

<ExtractNoSchemaOutput />

## Improving Results with Web Search

Setting `enableWebSearch = true` in your request will expand the crawl beyond the provided URL set. This can capture supporting or related information from linked pages.

Here's an example that extracts information about dash cams, enriching the results with data from related pages:

<CodeGroup>

<ExtractWebSearchPython />
<ExtractWebSearchJS />
<ExtractWebSearchCURL />

</CodeGroup>

### Example Response with Web Search

<ExtractWebSearchOutput />

The response includes additional context gathered from related pages, providing more comprehensive and accurate information.


## Extracting without URLs

The `/extract` endpoint now supports extracting structured data using a prompt without needing specific URLs. This is useful for research or when exact URLs are unknown. Currently in Alpha.

<CodeGroup>

<ExtractWithoutURLsPython />
<ExtractWithoutURLsJS />
<ExtractWithoutURLsCURL />

</CodeGroup>


## Known Limitations (Beta)

1. **Large-Scale Site Coverage**  
   Full coverage of massive sites (e.g., "all products on Amazon") in a single request is not yet supported.

2. **Complex Logical Queries**  
   Requests like "find every post from 2025" may not reliably return all expected data. More advanced query capabilities are in progress.

3. **Occasional Inconsistencies**  
   Results might differ across runs, particularly for very large or dynamic sites. Usually it captures core details, but some variation is possible.

4. **Beta State**  
   Since `/extract` is still in Beta, features and performance will continue to evolve. We welcome bug reports and feedback to help us improve.
