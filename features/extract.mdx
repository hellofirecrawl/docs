## Introducing /extract

Extract structured data from a single or multiple URLs using Large Language Models (LLMs). This new feature allows you to:
- Extract structured data from websites
- Connect or build data enrichment applications that need to structured data from websites
- Develop AI applications that need clean data from multiple websites

## Considerations

The `/extract` endpoint provides flexible data extraction with customizable schemas. Results can be improved through prompt tuning. We welcome your feedback.

## Extracting Data

### /extract endpoint

Used to extract structured data from multiple URLs. 

When specifying URLs, you can append `/*` to the URL to extract information from the entire website path rather than just a single page. 

For example, `https://firecrawl.dev/*` will attempt to extract data from all pages on the firecrawl.dev domain. The `/*` is still in beta so please let us know if you have any issues by emailing help@firecrawl.dev.

### Usage
<CodeGroup>

<ExtractPython />
<ExtractNode />
<ExtractCURL />

</CodeGroup>

For more details about the parameters, refer to the [API Reference](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/api-reference/endpoint/extract).

### Response

Receive the scraped data in the structured format defined by your schema. You can then use this data as needed in your application or for further processing.

<ExtractOutput />

### Extracting without schema

You can now extract without a schema by just passing a `prompt` to the endpoint. The LLM chooses the structure of the data.
