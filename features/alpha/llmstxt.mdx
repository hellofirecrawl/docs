## Introducing LLMs.txt Generator Endpoint (Alpha) 📃

The `/llmstxt` endpoint allows you to transform any website into clean, [LLM-ready text files](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/How-to-Create-an-llms-txt-File-for-Any-Website). Simply provide a URL, and Firecrawl will crawl the site and generate both `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` files that can be used for training or analysis with any LLM.

## How It Works

The LLMs.txt Generator:
1. Crawls the provided website URL and its linked pages
2. Extracts clean, meaningful text content
3. Generates two formats:
   - `llms.txt`: Concise summaries and key information
   - `llms-full.txt`: Complete text content with more detail

### Example Usage

<CodeGroup>

<GenerateLLMsTxtPython />
<GenerateLLMsTxtNode />
<GenerateLLMsTxtCURL />

</CodeGroup>

**Key Parameters:**

- **url**: The website URL to generate LLMs.txt files from
- **maxUrls** (Optional): Maximum number of pages to crawl (1-100, default: 10)
- **showFullText** (Optional): Generate llms-full.txt in addition to llms.txt (default: false)

See [API Reference](/api-reference/endpoint/llmstxt) for more details.

## Checking Generation Status

LLMs.txt generation runs asynchronously. Make the aync call and monitor the status with:

<CodeGroup>

<CheckStatusPython />
<CheckStatusNode />
<CheckStatusCURL />

</CodeGroup>

### Status Examples

#### In Progress

<StatusPending />

#### Completed

<StatusCompleted />

## Known Limitations (Alpha)

1. **Access Restrictions**  
Only publicly accessible pages can be processed. Login-protected or paywalled content is not supported.

2. **Site Size**  
We are only are allowing processing for up to 5000 URLs during the alpha stage.

3. **Alpha State**  
As an Alpha feature, the output format and processing may evolve based on feedback.

## Billing and Usage

Billing is based on the number of URLs processed:

- Base cost: 1 credit per URL processed
- Control URL costs with `maxUrls` parameter
