title: 'Search (Beta)'
openapi: 'POST /search'
---



The search endpoint combines a search API with the power of Firecrawl to provide a powerful search experience for whatever query. 

It automatically searches the web for the query and returns the most relevant results from the top pages in markdown format. The advantage of this endpoint is that it actually scrap each website on the top result so you always get the full content.

This endpoint is currently in beta and is subject to change.
