Firecrawl V1 is here! With that we introduce a more reliable and developer friendly API.

Here is what's new:

- Output Formats for `/scrape`. Choose what formats you want your output in.
- New [`/map` endpoint](/features/map) for getting most of the URLs of a webpage.
- Developer friendly API for `/crawl/{id}` status.
- 2x Rate Limits for all plans.
- [Go SDK](/sdks/go) and [Rust SDK](/sdks/rust)
- Teams support
- API Key Management in the dashboard.
- `onlyMainContent` is now default to `true`.
- `/crawl` webhooks and websocket support.


## Scrape Formats

You can now choose what formats you want your output in. You can specify multiple output formats. Supported formats are:

- Markdown (markdown)
- HTML (html)
- Raw HTML (rawHtml) (with no modifications)
- Screenshot (screenshot or screenshot@fullPage)
- Links (links)
- Extract (extract) - structured output

Output keys will match the format you choose.

<CodeGroup>

  <ScrapePython />

  <ScrapeNode />

  <ScrapeGo />

  <ScrapeRust />

  <ScrapeCURL />

</CodeGroup>

### Response

SDKs will return the data object directly. cURL will return the payload exactly as shown below.

<ScrapeResponse />

## Introducing /map (Alpha)

The easiest way to go from a single url to a map of the entire website.

### Usage

<CodeGroup>

<MapPython />
<MapJavaScript />
<MapGo />
<MapRust />
<MapCURL />

</CodeGroup>

### Response

SDKs will return the data object directly. cURL will return the payload exactly as shown below.

<MapResponse />

## WebSockets

To crawl a website with WebSockets, use the `Crawl URL and Watch` method.

<CodeGroup>

<CrawlWebSocketPythonBase />
<CrawlWebSocketNodeBase />

</CodeGroup>

## Extract format

LLM extraction is now available in v1 under the `extract` format. To extract structured from a page, you can pass a schema to the endpoint or just provide a prompt.

<CodeGroup>

<ExtractPython />
<ExtractNode />
<ExtractCURL />

</CodeGroup>

Output:

<ExtractOutput />

### Extracting without schema (New)

You can now extract without a schema by just passing a `prompt` to the endpoint. The llm chooses the structure of the data.

<CodeGroup>

<ExtractNoSchemaCURL />

</CodeGroup>

Output:

<ExtractNoSchemaOutput />

## New Crawl Webhook

You can now pass a `webhook` parameter to the `/crawl` endpoint. This will send a POST request to the URL you specify when the crawl is started, updated and completed.

The webhook will now trigger for every page crawled and not just the whole result at the end.

<CrawlWebhookCURL />

### Webhook Events

There are now 4 types of events:

- `crawl.started` - Triggered when the crawl is started.
- `crawl.page` - Triggered for every page crawled.
- `crawl.completed` - Triggered when the crawl is completed to let you know it's done.
- `crawl.failed` - Triggered when the crawl fails.

### Webhook Response

- `success` - If the webhook was successful in crawling the page correctly.
- `type` - The type of event that occurred.
- `id` - The ID of the crawl.
- `data` - The data that was scraped (Array). This will only be non empty on `crawl.page` and will contain 1 item if the page was scraped successfully. The response is the same as the `/scrape` endpoint.
- `error` - If the webhook failed, this will contain the error message.

## Migrating from V0

> ⚠️ **Deprecation Notice**: V0 endpoints will be deprecated on April 1st, 2025. Please migrate to V1 endpoints before then to ensure uninterrupted service.




## /scrape endpoint

The updated `/scrape` endpoint has been redesigned for enhanced reliability and ease of use. The structure of the new `/scrape` request body is as follows:

```json
{
  "url": "<string>",
  "formats": ["markdown", "html", "rawHtml", "links", "screenshot", "json"],
  "includeTags": ["<string>"],
  "excludeTags": ["<string>"],
  "headers": { "<key>": "<value>" },
  "waitFor": 123,
  "timeout": 123
}
```

### Formats

You can now choose what formats you want your output in. You can specify multiple output formats. Supported formats are:

- Markdown (markdown)
- HTML (html)
- Raw HTML (rawHtml) (with no modifications)
- Screenshot (screenshot or screenshot@fullPage)
- Links (links)
- JSON (json)

By default, the output will be include only the markdown format.

### Details on the new request body

The table below outlines the changes to the request body parameters for the `/scrape` endpoint in V1.

| Parameter | Change | Description |
| --------- | ------ | ----------- |
| `onlyIncludeTags` | Moved and Renamed | Moved to root level. And renamed to `includeTags`. |
| `removeTags` | Moved and Renamed | Moved to root level. And renamed to `excludeTags`. |
| `onlyMainContent`| Moved | Moved to root level. `true` by default. |
| `waitFor`| Moved | Moved to root level. |
| `headers`| Moved | Moved to root level. |
| `parsePDF`| Moved | Moved to root level. |
| `timeout`| No Change ||
| `pageOptions` | Removed | No need for `pageOptions` parameter. The scrape options were moved to root level. |
| `replaceAllPathsWithAbsolutePaths` | Removed | `replaceAllPathsWithAbsolutePaths` is not needed anymore. Every path is now default to absolute path. |
| `includeHtml`| Removed | add `"html"` to `formats` instead. |
| `includeRawHtml`| Removed | add `"rawHtml"` to `formats` instead. |
| `screenshot`| Removed | add `"screenshot"` to `formats` instead. |
| `fullPageScreenshot`| Removed | add `"screenshot@fullPage"` to `formats` instead. |
| `extractorOptions` | Removed | Use `"extract"` format instead with `extract` object. |

The new `extract` format is described in the [llm-extract](/features/extract) section.

## /crawl endpoint

We've also updated the `/crawl` endpoint on `v1`. Check out the improved body request below:

```json
{
  "url": "<string>",
  "excludePaths": ["<string>"],
  "includePaths": ["<string>"],
  "maxDepth": 2,
  "ignoreSitemap": true,
  "limit": 10,
  "allowBackwardLinks": true,
  "allowExternalLinks": true,
  "scrapeOptions": {
    // same options as in /scrape
    "formats": ["markdown", "html", "rawHtml", "screenshot", "links"],
    "headers": { "<key>": "<value>" },
    "includeTags": ["<string>"],
    "excludeTags": ["<string>"],
    "onlyMainContent": true,
    "waitFor": 123
  }
}
```
