## Installation

To install the Firecrawl Python SDK, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install firecrawl-py
```

## Usage

1. Get an API key from [firecrawl.dev](https://firecrawl.dev)
2. Set the API key as an environment variable named `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` or pass it as a parameter to the `FirecrawlApp` class.


Here's an example of how to use the SDK:

```python
from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp

# Initialize the FirecrawlApp with your API key
app = FirecrawlApp(api_key='your_api_key')

# Scrape a single URL
url = 'https://mendable.ai'
scraped_data = app.scrape_url(url)

# Crawl a website
crawl_url = 'https://mendable.ai'
params = {
    'pageOptions': {
        'onlyMainContent': True
    }
}
crawl_result = app.crawl_url(crawl_url, params=params)
```

### Scraping a URL

To scrape a single URL, use the `scrape_url` method. It takes the URL as a parameter and returns the scraped data as a dictionary.

```python
url = 'https://example.com'
scraped_data = app.scrape_url(url)
```

### Crawling a Website

To crawl a website, use the `crawl_url` method. It takes the starting URL and optional parameters as arguments. The `params` argument allows you to specify additional options for the crawl job, such as the maximum number of pages to crawl, allowed domains, and the output format.

The `wait_until_done` parameter determines whether the method should wait for the crawl job to complete before returning the result. If set to `True`, the method will periodically check the status of the crawl job until it is completed or the specified `timeout` (in seconds) is reached. If set to `False`, the method will return immediately with the job ID, and you can manually check the status of the crawl job using the `check_crawl_status` method.

```python
crawl_url = 'https://example.com'
params = {
    'crawlerOptions': {
        'excludes': ['blog/*'],
        'includes': [], # leave empty for all pages
        'limit': 1000,
    },
    'pageOptions': {
        'onlyMainContent': True
    }
}
crawl_result = app.crawl_url(crawl_url, params=params, wait_until_done=True, timeout=5)
```

If `wait_until_done` is set to `True`, the `crawl_url` method will return the crawl result once the job is completed. If the job fails or is stopped, an exception will be raised.

### Checking Crawl Status

To check the status of a crawl job, use the `check_crawl_status` method. It takes the job ID as a parameter and returns the current status of the crawl job.

```python
job_id = crawl_result['jobId']
status = app.check_crawl_status(job_id)
```

### Search for a query

Used to search the web, get the most relevant results, scrap each page and return the markdown.

```python
query = 'what is mendable?'
search_result = app.search(query)
```

## Error Handling

The SDK handles errors returned by the Firecrawl API and raises appropriate exceptions. If an error occurs during a request, an exception will be raised with a descriptive error message.
