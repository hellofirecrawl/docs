## Day 2 - FIRE-1 Agent

### Overview
Meet **FIRE-1**, Firecrawl's first AI Agent built to uncover data hidden behind any interaction barrier. With smart interaction capabilities, FIRE-1 can navigate through complex websites to access content that traditional scrapers can't reach without manual steps.

From clicking through filters to filling out forms, FIRE-1 interacts with dynamic site elements to reveal the content you need before scraping the final page.

### Key Features
- **Interactive Discovery**: Uncover hidden content by intelligently interacting with buttons, forms, and dynamic elements
- **Barrier Navigation**: Handle interaction flows, cookie notices, and other interaction requirements automatically
- **Context-Aware Scraping**: Extract data only after completing necessary interactions to reach the target content


## Day 1 - Change Tracking

### Overview
Change tracking is a powerful feature that allows you to monitor and detect changes in web content over time. It is available in both the JavaScript and Python SDKs.

### Key Features
- **Detect Changes**: Identify if a webpage has changed since the last scrape.
- **View Specific Changes**: Access detailed information about what has changed between scrapes.
- **Structured Data**: Receive structured data about the changes.
- **Visibility Control**: Manage the visibility of changes on your website.

Using the `changeTracking` format, you can effectively monitor changes on a website and receive comprehensive information about the timestamp of the previous scrape, the result of the comparison between the two page versions, and the visibility of the current page/URL.
