### Overview
Change tracking is a powerful feature that allows you to monitor and detect changes in web content over time. It is available in both the JavaScript and Python SDKs.

### Key Features
- **Detect Changes**: Identify if a webpage has changed since the last scrape.
- **View Specific Changes**: Access detailed information about what has changed between scrapes.
- **Structured Data**: Receive structured data about the changes.
- **Visibility Control**: Manage the visibility of changes on your website.

Using the `changeTracking` format, you can effectively monitor changes on a website and receive comprehensive information about the timestamp of the previous scrape, the result of the comparison between the two page versions, and the visibility of the current page/URL.
