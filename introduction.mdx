## What is Firecrawl?

Firecrawl is an API service that makes it easy to:
- Turn websites into clean, readable markdown content
- Extract structured data from any webpage 
- Crawl entire sites automatically, handling navigation and data collection

Think of it as your Swiss Army knife for getting data from the web into a format that works perfectly with AI and other applications.

## Quick Example

Here's a simple example of what Firecrawl can do:

<CodeGroup>
<ScrapePython />
<ScrapeNode />
<ScrapeCURL />
</CodeGroup>

This gives you clean, structured data from any webpage:

<ScrapeResponse />

  <Card title="Scrape" icon="screwdriver-wrench">
    Get content from a single webpage
    ```python
    content = app.scrape_url("https://example.com")
    ```
  </Card>
  <Card title="Crawl" icon="spider">
    Gather content from multiple pages automatically
    ```python
    results = app.crawl_url("https://example.com")
    ```
  </Card>
  <Card title="Extract" icon="code">
    Pull structured data using AI
    ```python
    data = app.extract(["https://example.com"])
    ```
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Core Features

- **Clean Formats**: Get data as markdown, HTML, structured JSON and more
- **Smart Handling**: Automatic handling of JavaScript, rate limits, and authentication
- **Media Support**: Extract from PDFs, images, and dynamic content
- **Reliability**: Designed to handle complex websites and edge cases
