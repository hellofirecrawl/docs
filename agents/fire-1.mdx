FIRE-1 is an AI agent that enhances Firecrawl's scraping capabilities. It can controls browser actions and navigates complex website structures to enable comprehensive data extraction beyond traditional scraping methods.

### What FIRE-1 Can Do On Scrape:
- Plan and take actions to uncover data
- Interact with buttons, links, inputs, and dynamic elements.



## How to Enable FIRE-1

Activating FIRE-1 is straightforward. Simply include an `agent` object in your scrape API request:

```json
"agent": {
  "model": "FIRE-1",
  "prompt": "Your detailed navigation instructions here."
}
```

*Note:* The `prompt` field is required for scrape requests, instructing FIRE-1 precisely how to interact with the webpage.

## Example Usage with Scrape Endpoint

Here's a quick example using FIRE-1 with the scrape endpoint to get the companies on the consumer space from Y Combinator:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/scrape \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://ycombinator.com/companies",
    "formats": ["markdown"],
    "agent": {
      "model": "FIRE-1",
      "prompt": "Get W22 companies on the consumer space by clicking the respective buttons"
    }
  }'
```
In this scenario, FIRE-1 intelligently clicks the W22 button, the Consumer space button and scrapes the companies.
