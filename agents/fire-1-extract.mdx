FIRE-1 is an AI agent that enhances Firecrawl's scraping capabilities through intelligent web navigation and interaction. It can handle pagination, control browser actions, and navigate complex website structures to enable comprehensive data extraction beyond traditional scraping methods.

### What FIRE-1 Can Do:

- Navigate through paginated content automatically.
- Interact with buttons, links, inputs, and dynamic elements.
- Perform sophisticated extraction tasks across multiple pages.


## Enabling FIRE-1 Agent

To enable the FIRE-1 agent, you need to include the `agent` object within your API request payload for either the `scrape` or `extract` endpoint.

The `agent` object has the following properties:

*   `model` (string, optional): Specifies the AI model to use. If not provided, it defaults to `FIRE-1`. Currently, `FIRE-1` is the only available model.
*   `prompt` (string, required for `scrape` endpoint): Provides instructions for the AI agent, describing what content to look for and how to navigate the website (e.g., how to handle pagination, buttons to click, etc.). In `/extract` it will use the prompt provided in the `prompt` parameter.

### Using FIRE-1 with the Scrape Endpoint

You can use the FIRE-1 agent with the `/v1/scrape` endpoint to apply intelligent navigation before scraping the final content.

**Example (cURL):**
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/scrape \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
    -d '{
      "url": "https://example.com/products?page=1",
      "formats": ["markdown"],
      "agent": {
        "model": "FIRE-1",
        "prompt": "Navigate through the product listings by clicking the \'Next Page\' button until it is disabled. Scrape the content of each page visited."
      }
    }'
```
In this example, the FIRE-1 agent is instructed to paginate through product listings before the final scrape occurs.

### Using FIRE-1 with the Extract Endpoint

Similarly, you can leverage the FIRE-1 agent with the `/v1/extract` endpoint for complex extraction tasks that require navigation across multiple pages or interaction with elements.

**Example (cURL):**

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/extract \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
    -d '{
      "urls": ["https://example-forum.com/topic/123"],
      "prompt": "Extract all user comments from this forum thread.",
      "schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "comments": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": {
              "type": "object",
              "properties": {
                "author": {"type": "string"},
                "comment_text": {"type": "string"}
              },
              "required": ["author", "comment_text"]
            }
          }
        },
        "required": ["comments"]
      },
      "agent": {
        "model": "FIRE-1"
      }
    }'
```

Here, the agent ensures all comments are loaded on the page by interacting with the "Load More Comments" button before the extraction process begins based on the provided schema and prompt.
**Note:** The FIRE-1 agent provides powerful capabilities but might consume more credits depending on the complexity of the navigation instructions and the number of pages interacted with.


### Meet FIRE-1: Intelligent Navigation and Interaction

FIRE-1 brings a new level of intelligence to Firecrawl, enhancing your scraping tasks by navigating complex website structures, handling pagination, interacting with dynamic content, and more. This powerful AI agent ensures comprehensive data extraction beyond traditional scraping methods.

### What FIRE-1 Can Do:

- Navigate through paginated content automatically.
- Interact with buttons, links, and dynamic elements.
- Perform sophisticated extraction tasks across multiple pages.

## How to Enable FIRE-1

Activating FIRE-1 is straightforward. Simply include an `agent` object in your scrape or extract API request:

```json
"agent": {
  "model": "FIRE-1",
  "prompt": "Your detailed navigation instructions here."
}
```

*Note:* The `prompt` field is required for scrape requests, instructing FIRE-1 precisely how to interact with the webpage.

## Example Usage with Scrape Endpoint

Here's a quick example using FIRE-1 with the scrape endpoint to paginate through product listings:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/scrape \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://example.com/products?page=1",
    "formats": ["markdown"],
    "agent": {
      "model": "FIRE-1",
      "prompt": "Navigate through the product listings by clicking the \'Next Page\' button until disabled. Scrape each page."
    }
  }'
```
In this scenario, FIRE-1 intelligently navigates pagination and gathers all of the products.
## Considerations
- Using FIRE-1 may consume more credits based on task complexity and interaction depth.
- Ensure your prompts clearly guide FIRE-1 to optimize results and efficiency.
