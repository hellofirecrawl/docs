## Installation

To install the Firecrawl Python SDK, you can use pip:

<InstallationPython />

## Usage

1. Get an API key from [firecrawl.dev](https://firecrawl.dev)
2. Set the API key as an environment variable named `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` or pass it as a parameter to the `FirecrawlApp` class.


Here's an example of how to use the SDK:

<ScrapeAndCrawlExamplePython />

### Scraping a URL

To scrape a single URL, use the `scrape_url` method. It takes the URL as a parameter and returns the scraped data as a dictionary.

### Crawling a Website

To crawl a website, use the `crawl_url` method. It takes the starting URL and optional parameters as arguments. The `params` argument allows you to specify additional options for the crawl job, such as the maximum number of pages to crawl, allowed domains, and the output format.

### Asynchronous Crawling

To crawl a website asynchronously, use the `crawl_url_async` method. It returns the crawl `ID` which you can use to check the status of the crawl job. It takes the starting URL and optional parameters as arguments. The `params` argument allows you to specify additional options for the crawl job, such as the maximum number of pages to crawl, allowed domains, and the output format.

### Checking Crawl Status

To check the status of a crawl job, use the `check_crawl_status` method. It takes the job ID as a parameter and returns the current status of the crawl job.

### Map a Website

Use `map_url` to generate a list of URLs from a website. The `params` argument let you customize the mapping process, including options to exclude subdomains or to utilize the sitemap.

### Crawling a Website with WebSockets

To crawl a website with WebSockets, use the `crawl_url_and_watch` method. It takes the starting URL and optional parameters as arguments. The `params` argument allows you to specify additional options for the crawl job, such as the maximum number of pages to crawl, allowed domains, and the output format.

## Error Handling

The SDK handles errors returned by the Firecrawl API and raises appropriate exceptions. If an error occurs during a request, an exception will be raised with a descriptive error message.
